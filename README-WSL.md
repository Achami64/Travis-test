# Setting up the Windows Subsystem for Linux for Unit-13-DevOps

## If you are on Windows but not already using WSL

- Follow this [link to our precourse material](https://github.com/CodesmithLLC/precourse-part-1/blob/master/windows-os.md). You will find isntructions on how to properly setup WSL on your machine. You only need to follow the steps for setting up WSL and the VS Code to work with WSL. Feel free to skip the part in setting up Node.js for now, as we won't need it for this unit.
